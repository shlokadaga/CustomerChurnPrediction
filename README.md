# CustomerChurnPrediction
Customer churn is the percentage of customers that stopped using your company's product or service during a certain time frame. For example, if you start your quarter with 400 customers and end with 380, your churn rate is 5% because you lost 5% of your customers.

Obviously, your company should aim for a churn rate that is as close to 0% as possible. In order to do this, your company has to be on top of its churn rate at all times and treat it as a top priority.
